# Retail-store-program.

Program Scenario:

Electronic retail store program.
 Let’s assume that the store sells books and software only. (As it is open source users can modify it later on for their own products) The software should allow staff to enter new stock, and for customers to be able to purchase that stock. Customers do not need to have direct access to the software and can make orders by calling the store. The staff members will place the orders on the customers’ behalf.

Software Requirements:

•	Product details must be stored. These include: product id, product name, cost, year of publication and publishing house.
•	For books you must also store the author, ISBN and number of pages.
•	Software details must store the minimum computer system requirements (e.g. RAM and processor requirements).
•	All product details are mandatory (i.e. validation rules).
•	Members of staff will have an interface to enter new products.
•	Appropriate use of inheritance is expected in this section.

•	Customers make orders by browsing the products and selecting the ones that they want to purchase.
•	Customers are given a total cost before each order is finalised.
•	After selecting the products, customers are asked to enter their contact and payment details. Thereafter the order is submitted and stored.
•	The date of the order must be stored.

•	Members of staff are able to see a list of all the orders that have been made so that they may dispatch the items to the customers.

•	Validation rules must be implemented so that inappropriate data is not entered (e.g. number of book pages cannot be lower than 1). These rules should be implemented into the relevant object methods.
